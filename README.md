# Integrated Multi-Omics Bioinformatics Capstone Project (BINF7700)

A capstone bioinformatics project exploring biological datasets using reproducible computational workflows, with an emphasis on transcriptomic and multi-omics analysis.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the evolving work for my BINF7700 capstone project. The goal is to design and implement a reproducible bioinformatics workflow to explore and analyze biological data, integrate multiple data types where possible, and extract meaningful biological insights.

The specific research question and dataset will be refined during the term.

## Dataset (Preliminary)

- Source: To be determined (public biological dataset)
- Data type: Transcriptomics / multi-omics
- Organism or system: To be determined

## Planned Analysis Pipeline

- Data acquisition and quality control  
- Exploratory data analysis  
- Statistical or differential analysis  
- Visualization and interpretation  
- Documentation and reproducibility via GitHub  

## Technical Skills and Tools

- Programming: Python, R, Bash  
- Bioinformatics: RNA-seq processing, differential expression, FASTA/FASTQ handling  
- Data Analysis: tidyverse, pandas, ggplot2  
- Computing: Linux, SLURM-based HPC, Singularity containers  
- Version Control: Git and GitHub  

## Learning Goals

- Strengthen reproducible research practices using GitHub  
- Improve confidence in analyzing biological datasets end-to-end  
- Practice translating biological questions into computational workflows  
- Develop clearer documentation and presentation of results
